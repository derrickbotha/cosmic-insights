# Crystal Recommendations System - User Guide

## üîÆ Overview

The Crystal Recommendations system is a unique feature that bridges astrology, psychology, and crystal healing. It analyzes your complete energetic blueprint to prescribe crystals that resonate with your planetary energies, emotional patterns, and life focus.

## üåü How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
The system gathers information from three sources:

#### Astrological Data
- **Sun Sign**: Your core identity and life force
- **Moon Sign**: Your emotional nature and subconscious
- **Rising Sign**: How you present to the world
- **Dominant Planets**: Your strongest planetary influences (e.g., Mars-driven, Saturn-heavy)

#### Journal Sentiment Analysis
- **Emotional Keywords**: Words that appear frequently in your entries
- **Recurring Themes**: Patterns like "fear of loss," "creative block," "relationship healing"
- **Dominant Emotions**: Your primary emotional state

#### Life Focus Category
Choose one of six areas:
1. **Career & Success**: Professional growth, confidence, abundance
2. **Emotional Healing**: Processing trauma, building self-love, releasing pain
3. **Spiritual Growth**: Deepening practice, intuition, divine connection
4. **Creativity & Expression**: Unblocking creative flow, inspiration, artistic confidence
5. **Relationships & Connection**: Opening heart, healthy boundaries, communication
6. **Self-Worth & Confidence**: Building self-esteem, overcoming shame, personal power

### 2. Analysis Process

The system performs a multi-layered analysis:

#### Layer 1: Planetary Alignment
- Matches your Sun, Moon, and dominant planets to their corresponding crystals
- Example: Gemini Sun ‚Üí Fluorite (mental clarity) + Blue Lace Agate (communication)

#### Layer 2: Emotional Patterns

- Prescribes crystals that address specific emotional needs
- Example: Recurring anxiety ‚Üí Amethyst (calms mind) + Lepidolite (contains lithium)

#### Layer 3: Life Focus
- Selects 2-3 primary crystals for your chosen focus area
- Adds supportive crystals for complementary healing
- Example: Career focus ‚Üí Tiger's Eye (confidence) + Pyrite (abundance) + Green Aventurine (opportunity)

### 3. Recommendation Output

You receive:

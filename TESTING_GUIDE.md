# üß™ Registration Testing Guide

## Quick Start

Your registration form is now fixed and ready to test! Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open the Application
1. Open your browser (Chrome recommended)
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**
3. You should see the landing page with the registration form

### Step 2: Open Developer Tools
1. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
2. Go to the **Console** tab (to see logs)
3. Go to the **Network** tab (to see API requests)

### Step 3: Fill the Registration Form

**‚úÖ Valid Example:**
- **Name:** John Doe
- **Username:** johndoe123 (optional - leave blank to auto-generate)
- **Email:** john@example.com
- **Password:** MyPass123
- **Confirm Password:** MyPass123

**Password Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ At least 8 characters
- ‚úÖ At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)

| `mypassword` | Missing uppercase and number |
| `MyPassword` | Missing number |
| `MYPASS123` | Missing lowercase |

### Step 4: Submit the Form

1. Click the **Sign Up** button
2. Watch the **Console tab** - you should see:
   ```
   Form submitted! {showLogin: false, formData: {...}}
   Calling onRegister...
   authService.register called with: {email: "...", name: "...", username: "..."}
   Sending registration request to: http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
   Registration response status: 201
   Registration response data: {success: true, ...}
   Registration result: {success: true, ...}
   ```

3. Watch the **Network tab** - you should see:
   - **Request:** POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
   - **Status:** 201 Created
   - **Response:** User data

### Step 5: Verify Success

**In the Browser:**
- ‚úÖ Success message displayed
- ‚úÖ Redirected to dashboard or questionnaire

**In Console:**
- ‚úÖ No errors
- ‚úÖ All logs showing successful registration
- ‚úÖ User data received

**In Network Tab:**
- ‚úÖ POST request sent to backend
- ‚úÖ Status code 201
- ‚úÖ Response contains user data

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Password must be at least 8 characters..."

**Cause:** Password doesn't meet complexity requirements

**Solution:** Make sure your password has:
- At least 8 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 number

**Example Fix:**
- ‚ùå `password` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `Password1`
- ‚ùå `PASSWORD` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `Password1`
- ‚ùå `Pass123` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `Pass1234`

### Issue: "Passwords do not match"

**Cause:** Password and Confirm Password fields don't match

**Solution:** Type the same password in both fields carefully

### Issue: No console logs appearing

**Cause 1:** Developer Tools not open
**Solution:** Press F12 to open Developer Tools

**Cause 2:** Console tab not selected
**Solution:** Click on the "Console" tab in Developer Tools

**Cause 3:** Logs filtered out
**Solution:** Make sure no filters are active in Console (check the filter buttons at the top)

### Issue: No network requests in Network tab

**Cause 1:** Network tab not open before submitting
**Solution:** Open Network tab, then submit form again

**Cause 2:** Password validation failing (form not submitting)
**Solution:** Check Console for validation errors, fix password

### Issue: Form submits but no response

**Cause:** Backend not running
**Solution:** Check backend status:
```powershell
docker-compose ps
```

All containers should show "Up" status. If backend is down:
```powershell
docker-compose up -d backend
```

### Issue: CORS Error in Console

**Example Error:**
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution:** Restart backend:
```powershell
docker-compose restart backend
```

## üß™ Advanced Testing

### Test 1: Direct API Test from Browser Console

Open Console and paste:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: 'test@test.com',
    password: 'TestPass123',
    name: 'Test User',
    username: 'testuser'
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log('‚úÖ Success:', data))
.catch(err => console.error('‚ùå Error:', err));
```

### Test 2: Check Backend Logs

In PowerShell:
```powershell
docker-compose logs backend --tail 50
```

Look for:
```
POST /api/auth/register 201 xxx.xxx ms - 233
Auth Event {"event":"user_registered","userId":"..."}
```

### Test 3: Verify User in Database

```powershell
docker-compose exec mongodb mongosh cosmic_insights --eval "db.users.find({}, {name:1, email:1, username:1}).pretty()"
```

You should see your newly registered user!

### Test 4: Test Login with New User

1. After successful registration, you'll be redirected
2. If you need to test login:
   - Log out (if logged in)
   - Click "Sign In"
   - Enter your email and password
   - Click "Sign In"

## üìù Notes

- **Email Verification:** Currently showing a warning in backend logs because Gmail SMTP isn't configured. This is normal! Users are still created successfully, but verification emails aren't sent. See REGISTRATION_FIX.md for email setup instructions.

- **Username Auto-generation:** If you leave the username field blank, a username will be auto-generated from your email address.

- **Password Storage:** Passwords are hashed on the backend using bcrypt. They are never stored in plain text.

- **JWT Tokens:** On successful registration, you'll receive a JWT token that's automatically stored in your browser.

Everything is set up and ready. Just:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Press F12
3. Fill the form with a valid password

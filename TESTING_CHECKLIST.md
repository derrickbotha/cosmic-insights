## 🐛 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: Frontend not running
**Fix**: `npm start`

### Issue: Backend not responding
**Fix**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.mailpit.yml restart backend`

### Issue: No email in Mailpit
**Fix**: 
1. Check Mailpit running: `docker ps | findstr mailpit`
2. Restart: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.mailpit.yml restart mailpit`

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" error
**Fix**: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### Issue: Verification link goes to wrong port
**Fix**: Check `CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:4000` in docker-compose.mailpit.yml

### Issue: Auto-login doesn't work
**Fix**: 
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify cookies are set (DevTools → Application → Cookies)
3. Restart backend: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.mailpit.yml restart backend`

## 📊 Backend Verification

### Check Logs
```powershell
# Backend logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.mailpit.yml logs backend --tail 50

# Should see:
# "Email verification email sent to test@example.com"
# "email_verified_with_autologin" event logged
```

### Check Database
```powershell
# Connect to MongoDB
docker exec -it cosmic-mongodb mongosh

# Check user verified
use astrology_db
db.users.findOne({email: "test@example.com"}, {emailVerified: 1, email: 1, username: 1})

# Should show:
# { emailVerified: true, email: "test@example.com", username: "testuser" }
```

## 🔒 Security Verification

### Tokens
- ✅ Verification tokens are SHA-256 hashed in database
- ✅ Tokens expire after 24 hours
- ✅ Tokens deleted after use (single-use)

### Cookies
- ✅ `refreshToken` set as httpOnly (check DevTools)
- ✅ `csrfToken` set in sessionStorage
- ✅ Cookies cleared on logout

### Passwords
- ✅ Minimum 12 characters enforced
- ✅ Complexity requirements checked
- ✅ Bcrypt hashing with 12 rounds

## 📈 Performance Check

### Page Load Times
- ✅ VerifyEmail component loads: <100ms
- ✅ Auto-login completes: <500ms
- ✅ Redirect to dashboard: <2s (intentional delay)

### API Response Times

## 🚀 Production Deployment Notes

Before deploying to production:

1. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   CLIENT_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com (or your SMTP)
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_SECURE=true
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   ```

2. **Update CORS**:
   ```env
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Enable HTTPS**:
   - Service worker requires HTTPS in production
   - Cookies require `secure: true` flag

4. **Test Email Delivery**:
   - Replace Mailpit with real SMTP
   - Test with real email addresses
   - Check spam folder

5. **Monitor**:
   - Track verification success rate
   - Monitor auto-login errors
   - Check session creation logs

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Clear cache often** during testing to avoid service worker issues
- **Use Mailpit** for development (no real email limits)
- **Check browser console** for detailed error messages
- **Monitor backend logs** for server-side issues
- **Test on multiple browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

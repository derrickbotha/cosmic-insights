## 📊 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

### Registration Flow (✅ COMPLETED):
```
1. User fills registration form
2. Frontend sends POST to /api/auth/register
3. Backend creates user with emailVerified: false
4. Backend generates verification token (JWT)
5. Backend sends email via Mailpit
6. Backend returns 201 Created
7. Frontend shows success message ✅
```

### Email Verification Flow (⏳ PENDING):
```
1. User checks Mailpit web UI (http://localhost:8025)
2. User clicks verification link
3. Link opens: /verify-email?token=...
4. Frontend sends token to backend
5. Backend verifies token
6. Backend sets emailVerified: true
7. Backend sends welcome email
8. User can now login! ✅
```

### Login Flow (🔒 BLOCKED - WAITING FOR VERIFICATION):
```
1. User tries to login
2. Backend checks emailVerified status
3. Status is false → Return 403 Forbidden ❌
4. After verification, status is true → Login works ✅
```
